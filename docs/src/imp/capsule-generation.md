# Capsule (Study Session) Generation

Capsules are generated server-side by the Management Console backend and tracked per-student.

## Generation Algorithm

1. **Query overdue cards** from the student's assigned track profile (libSQL)
2. **Sort by FSRS urgency** (lowest retention probability first)
3. **Guarantee minimum per-track presence** in the interleaved mix
4. **Slice** the card pool into N equal chunks (N = N-Lever value)
5. **Apply hard cap** (max cards per session)
6. **Spill-over** remaining cards to the next session

    pub track_profile_id: String,
    pub n_value: i32,
    pub session_duration_minutes: i32,
    pub card_ids: String,       // JSON array
    pub status: String,         // pending | in_progress | completed | expired
